            This implementation doesn't have infinite boundaries for cells. Any cell that has neighbors that are out of the grid count as alive. Try loading some of the prefabs to see some cool patterns.

            Click on squares to reveal what is beneath. But be careful,
            or you may just click on a bomb! Use the numbers as hints to where the bombs are and mark
            all bombs by right clicking on the squares.
            If you reveal all bomb-free squares, you win!
