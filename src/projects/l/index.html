    via an attribute, but those have different meanings. You could also use this to apply styles to the DOM node. Supplying the

Programming languages like lisps, python, and c have done it too. However, these proogramming languages don't run directly
in the browser like Javascript does. Those libraries are created for web servers

a good use case for such a library.
